# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎅  

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2025** repository! 🧑‍💻✨  
Every day in December, I'll be attempting festive programming puzzles and uploading my Python solutions here. 🎁  

## 🛠️ What's in the Stocking?  
- **Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Daily Solutions:** Each day brings a new problem and a new solution! Check out the folders for each star.  
- **Festive Fun:** Clean code wrapped with some holiday cheer!  

## 🎶 Jingle Code, Jingle Code... 🎶  
This repo isn't just about solving puzzles; it's about spreading holiday joy through code! Here's how you can join in:  
1. Try the puzzles yourself on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).  
2. Compare our approaches—there’s no wrong way to solve them!  
3. Star this repo ⭐ if you like what you see (Santa says sharing is caring!).
