# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to **Advent of Code**, organized by year.

## Languages by Year
- **2024** – Python  
- **2025** – Java  

I use Advent of Code as a way to practice algorithmic problem-solving and improve implementation fluency in different languages.

## Structure
- Each year has its own directory
- Solutions are grouped by day/star
- Input files are stored alongside or under resources (for Java)

Some solutions may be refactored after initial completion to improve clarity or performance.
